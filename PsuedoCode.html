		<h1>PSUEDO CODE</h1>
		<p>This pseudo code is a brief summary of what was learned doing the first two weeks of class. <img src="Psuedocode.png" <p>I forgot the "end", command, but everything else checks out. This exercise was helpful because it made the course seem less daunting. Completed 02/07/2020.</p>
